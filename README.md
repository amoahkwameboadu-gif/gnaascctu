# GNAAS CCTU Chapter — Website (React + Vite + Tailwind)

A faithful, feature-for-feature rebuild of the live site **https://gnass-cctu.vercel.app/**
(Ghana National Association of Adventist Students — Cape Coast Technical University chapter).

- Same markup structure, class names, ids, text, links and images as the live `index.html`
  (verified element-by-element: 439/439 elements match).
- The original stylesheet is used **verbatim** (`src/styles/site.css`), so the look is identical.
  Tailwind is wired in with *theme + utilities only* — its Preflight reset is disabled on purpose
  so it cannot alter the original design.
- The original admin portal (`admin.html`) is included as a hash route: **`#/admin`**.

The untouched original source files are kept for reference in [`original-site/`](original-site/).

## Features (all carried over)

**Public site**
- Sticky header with logo, 5-link nav, **dark-mode toggle** (remembers choice, falls back to OS setting),
  Give CTA, mobile hamburger menu that closes on link tap, header shadow on scroll, skip link.
- Hero with sepia **Adventist pioneers collage** (Wikimedia Commons) and a gently shaking *Announcements* button.
- **Sabbath countdown** in Ghana time (Africa/Accra) to Friday 6:00 PM, ticking every second.
- **Latest Message** — GNAAS Congress 2026 video; replaced automatically when the admin publishes a new message.
- **Weekly schedule** — the card for the activity happening *right now* (Ghana time) is highlighted.
- About (stats), Ministries & departments grid.
- **Media reels** row: Event Highlights **auto-slideshow** (61 photos, 4 s, pause on hover, dot navigation),
  Church Dues & Welfare (tap-to-call), Virtual Prayer Meeting (Google Meet), placeholders, View More.
  Published media updates replace the reels.
- **SDA Live hub** — Adventist News Network feed (RSS → JSON, refreshed every 15 min, graceful fallback),
  Sabbath School iframe, Hope Channel Ghana TikTok embed, 3ABN Sabbath School Panel iframe, resource links.
- **Filterable events** calendar (All / Worship / Social / Outreach / Sports).
- **Executive team** in hierarchy groups with *View More* / *Return to Core*.
- **Prayer wall** — adds the request to the list and opens SMS to `0509511619` pre-filled.
- Give options, Alumni WhatsApp CTA, footer with community WhatsApp + Admin portal link — the footer has no
  extra links, exactly like the live site. (A one-click "save the whole site as one HTML file" button used to sit
  here; the code is still in `src/lib/downloadSite.ts` if you want it back — import `downloadSiteHtml` and call it.)
- Scroll-reveal animations (respects `prefers-reduced-motion`).

**Admin portal (`admin.html`)** — deliberately minimal
- Sign-in using the admin token configured by the site owner; the token is held
  in session storage and cleared when the browser tab session ends.
- Three panels: *Latest message*, *Media update*, *Calendar event* — write, publish, and delete from the list below each.
- A small badge in the header: **Live** (API connected) or **Saved in this browser**.
- Drag-and-drop uploads with type/size validation (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, MP4, WebM, MOV — max 4 MB for Vercel) and preview.
- Toast confirmations, draft auto-save, character counters, auto-growing textareas,
  **Ctrl/Cmd + S** to save, loading spinners.

## Backend — three ways to run the site

All three options build from the same code and speak the same API contract.

| | What it is | Needs | Updates reach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A** | Node server (`server/index.mjs`) | Node 20+ | every visitor |
| **B** | Vercel functions (`api/` + `vercel.json`) | a Vercel project + KV/Blob stores | every visitor |
| **C** | One downloadable HTML file (`gnaas-cctu-chapter.html`) | nothing at all | the browser it was edited in |

**Option C is already generated for you** — `gnaas-cctu-chapter.html` in the project root (287 KB).
Double-click it to open the whole site, or regenerate it any time with `bash scripts/export-html.sh`.

### Option A — the bundled Node server (no dependencies, works right now)

Serves the built site **and** the API from one address, storing content in
`data/content.json` and uploads in `data/uploads/`.

```bash
npm run build
node server/index.mjs          # → http://localhost:4173
```

Environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `4173` | port to listen on |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | interface to bind |
| `GNAAS_DATA_DIR` | `./data` | where `content.json` + `uploads/` live |
| `GNAAS_DIST_DIR` | `./dist` | the built site to serve |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | *(unset)* | signs admin session cookies; falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `ALLOW_SIGNUP` | `true` | set `false` to close public account creation |

Deploy it anywhere Node runs (Render, Railway, Fly.io, a VPS, `pm2`, Docker) and the admin
portal publishes to all visitors. Admin routes require a signed-in account; public content
stays readable without one (see below).

### Option B — Vercel serverless functions

The `api/` functions store the public content in `data/site-content.json` on this
repository's `main` branch. Configure these environment variables in Vercel:

1. `GITHUB_TOKEN` — required. Use a fine-grained GitHub token scoped to
   `amoahkwameboadu-gif/GNASS-CCTU` with **Contents: read and write** permission.
   Keep this value only in Vercel's encrypted environment settings; never put it
   in browser code or commit it.
2. `SESSION_SECRET` — recommended. A long random string used to sign admin session
   cookies. If you leave it unset, the app falls back to signing with
   `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which works but ties your sessions to one secret.
3. `ALLOW_SIGNUP` — optional, defaults to `true`. Set it to `false` to close public
   account creation; signed-in editors can then still add accounts from
   `/api/admin/users`.
4. `GITHUB_REPO_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO_NAME`, and `GITHUB_BRANCH` — optional;
   they default to `amoahkwameboadu-gif`, `GNASS-CCTU`, and `main`.
5. Redeploy after setting or changing environment variables.

### Admin accounts

> **Vercel counts every file under `api/` as a serverless function**, including helper
> modules, and the Hobby plan caps that at 12. Routes are therefore authored in TypeScript
> under `api-src/`, bundled to CommonJS in `api/`, and shared code lives in `lib/`.
> Run `npm run build:api` after editing anything in `api-src/` or `lib/` — the compiled
> output is committed. This project ships 10 functions, leaving 2 slots spare.
>
> The bundle keeps `dependencies` external, so Vercel installs `@octokit/rest` for the
> function the usual way. Compiled output is plain JavaScript because Vercel does not
> reliably compile `.ts` files in `api/` — every route returned
> `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` until this change.

The admin portal uses real accounts rather than a single shared password:

- Anyone can create an account at `/admin.html` while `ALLOW_SIGNUP` is on.
- **The first account created becomes the `owner`**; later accounts are `editors`.
- Passwords are hashed with `scrypt` and a per-user random salt. Only the hash and
  salt are stored — in `data/admin-users.json` on this repo's `main` branch.
- Signing in sets an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie holding a signed, 7-day
  session. Nothing is kept in browser storage, so closing the browser ends nothing
  but the cookie still expires on its own.
- `/api/admin/users` lists accounts, and lets any signed-in editor add or remove
  them (an owner cannot be deleted if it is the last one).

Because sign-ups are open by default, anyone who finds `/admin.html` can edit the
site. Set `ALLOW_SIGNUP=false` once your team accounts exist.

Without `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `SESSION_SECRET`, the admin API responds with a
configuration error and the portal cannot load or publish shared content. Public
content remains readable without signing in. Writes create commits to
`data/site-content.json`, so the GitHub token needs write permission.
Uploaded media is committed separately under `uploads/` and served from the
repository's raw-content URL. Vercel limits function request bodies to about
4.5 MB, so the portal caps files at 4 MB to leave room for multipart form data.

| Endpoint | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/content` | GET — public feed polled every 30 s |
| `/api/health` | GET — a plain readiness/status report |
| `/api/admin/content` | GET, PUT — load dashboard / publish latest message |
| `/api/admin/media` | POST — upload image or video (`FormData` field `file`) |
| `/api/admin/media-updates` | POST — publish a reel |
| `/api/admin/media-updates/:id` | DELETE — delete a reel |
| `/api/admin/events` | POST — add a calendar event |
| `/api/admin/events/:id` | DELETE — delete a calendar event |
| `/api/admin/auth` | GET, POST — `login`, `register`, `logout` |
| `/api/admin/users` | GET, POST, DELETE — manage editor accounts |

### Option C — one HTML file, no backend

```bash
bash scripts/export-html.sh      # → gnaas-cctu-chapter.html
```

The script builds the site and copies the single-file bundle to the project root. That file **is**
the whole website — public site and admin portal, all CSS and JavaScript inlined, no server, no
build step, no dependencies:

- open it by double-clicking (works offline; images, fonts and the embedded feeds need internet),
- host it anywhere: GitHub Pages, Netlify drop, any web space, a USB stick, an email attachment,
- regenerate after any change with `bash scripts/export-html.sh`.

In this mode the admin portal writes to the browser it is used from (the header badge reads
**Saved in this browser**), which is ideal for demos, offline meetings or handing the site to
someone. For updates that reach all visitors, use Option A or B.

### How the admin portal finds the backend

The address is simply **`/api` on the same origin**, which is what both hosting options use — the
Vercel functions on a Vercel deployment, and the Node server (which serves the site and the API
together). There is nothing to configure, so the portal itself is minimal: three panels
(Latest message, Media update, Calendar event) and a small badge that reads **Live** when the API is
answering or **Saved in this browser** when it is not.

If you ever need to point the site elsewhere without editing code, set either of these in
`localStorage` (defaults live in `src/lib/apiConfig.ts`):

| Key | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `gnaas-api-base` | `https://my-api.onrender.com/api` |
| `gnaas-api-token` | *no longer used* — the portal signs in with an account and relies on its session cookie |

## Assets

Images and video are still served from the live deployment via one constant in `src/data/site.ts`:

```ts
export const ASSET_BASE = 'https://gnass-cctu.vercel.app/';
```

To self-host them, copy these from the original repo into `public/` and set `ASSET_BASE = ''`:

- `gnasscctulogo.png`
- `sermons and events/` → `congress.mp4`, `CHURCH DUES 2.png`, `prayer meeting.jpg`
- `images/` → executive photos (see `EXECUTIVE_GROUPS` in `src/data/site.ts`)
- `images/slideshows/` → 61 event photos (see `SLIDESHOW_IMAGES`)

Some photos are hosted on ImgBB (`i.ibb.co`) exactly as on the live site.

## Scripts

```bash
npm install
npm run dev                      # local development

npm run build                    # production build → dist/index.html (single file)
node server/index.mjs            # Option A: serve the build + the API on :4173

bash scripts/export-html.sh      # Option C: → gnaas-cctu-chapter.html
bash scripts/run-checks.sh       # 155 assertions (browser storage, downloads, real server)
```

`run-checks.sh` bundles `scripts/local-flow.check.mts` (admin → main-site flow in normal,
IndexedDB-blocked and fully-blocked browsers) and `scripts/api-flow.check.mts` (a real
`server/index.mjs` driven over HTTP: publish, upload, add/delete, restart persistence, the
optional write password, and the single-file download helpers).
